# Hexgen

## What

This is an idea I got from a friend of mine. It takes lambda expressions and converts them into drawings of magic circles.
The drawing logic itself is pretty basic, but I plan to add a couple of features such as:

- [ ] Color Selection
- [ ] Gradients
- [ ] More sophisticated circles
- [ ] Export to SVG/PNG
- [ ] maybe more?

## How

First have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) installed, then just run `yarn install && yarn build`. The output will be in the dist folder and should be usable as is.
